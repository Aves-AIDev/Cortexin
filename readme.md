# My learning journey of Machine Learning Development all using Rust

### Purpose 
Main Goal is to experiment Machine Learning in Rust-Lang , this is just my approach towards learning and developing ML algorithms in Rust. Reason to select Rust; recognised by community as Safe (data/memory vulnerabilities are avoided at best) tool. As in Machine Learning Data is most important aspect of development, so Rust makes most sense.
I am not Expert in Rust tool, but it will be great learning experience and i decided to not use any AI code completion or other helper tools for development of Algorithms code, writing all with my try and error will make my appriciate my work more.

### What i am experimenting 
Main experiment will be comparing performance of Machine Learning Models or Algorithms in Rust vs Python. I also don't have complete knowledge if all current ML Algorithms are written in `C/C++` and used in python as library. if so , then comparing performance `vs C/C++` will be required.

**key performance metrics** ( current as i am writing down my initial goals for this project, i assume this are relevant and important metrics. Will update with more relevant/necessary metrics if needed )

 - compiling of code (or speed)
 - data/memory safety (is data or learned patterns been lost due to memory errors or not , and how much)

will start with basic machine learning models ( regression first and test )
